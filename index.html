    <p><h2>Make your cake and have it too.</h2></p>
    <p>We came together after countless hours poured over family cookbooks, frustrated that our culinary legacy had been ruined by sauce splatters, butter smudges, and sugary stains. If only there was a way to preserve these recipes for generations. Past attempts at digitizing our recipe boxes ended up with floppy disk, zip drives, and burned cd's filled with recipes that could no longer be accessed as older technology became obsolete. Our new online database allows users to create, edit, and store any recipe from any device with internet access. No longer do you need to worry about downloading and printing off files. Edit once, store always. Share your favorites with friends and family!</p>

    <p><h2>Let us take care of your recipes.</h2></p>
    <p>We know that your recipes are more than just a set of instructions to follow in the kitchen. They are your legacy, your lifeline to your ancestors. Everytime you recreate a batch of Grandma's cookies you are connecting with Grandma. The old fashioned wooden box with stained index cards, while quite charming, doesn't have to be your only avenue for recipe storage. You can keep your recipe cards with Grandma's handwriting, but you can also rest easy knowing you have a back-up online accessible at anytime!
